The Wulff's Theorem can be used to analyse the energy of accelerated synthesis of [material discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9). 

> Let $\gamma(\hat{n})$ be the surface energy per unit area (surface tension) of a face with unit outer normal $\hat{n}$. For a given enclosed volume $V$, the equilibrium shape $S$ is given by:

$S = {r \hat{n} : r â‰¤ \frac{\gamma(\hat{n})}{\gamma(h)} \text{ for all unit vectors } \hat{n}}$

Where $h$ is the orientation for which $\gamma(h)$ is minimum.


The shape $S$ described above is called the Wulff shape. Some key properties:

 
- The distance $r$ to a face is proportional to its surface energy $\gamma$
- Faces with low surface energy extend farther from the origin
- The Wulff shape exhibits faceting from surface energy anisotropy

- Actual crystals tend to take on shapes close to but not necessarily identical the Wulff shape
- The Wulff shape shows how microscale surface energetics inform macroscale equilibrium geometry
